                                   SUMMARY


LG is a Looking Glass written in Perl as a CGI script. It can execute almost
all BGP-related commands and do ping and traceroute in routers or relay these
queries to other looking glasses. It supports both IPv4 and IPv6 commands,
and is tested with Cisco, Zebra and Juniper. It can connect to router using
either SSH, telnet or rsh protocol.

LG is released under GPL licence. Look at COPYING file.



                                   INSTALL


This example assumes that you use Apache webserver and LG will be installed
to /usr/local/httpd/htdocs/lg directory.


1. Create directory where you want to keep LG files

mkdir /usr/local/httpd/htdocs/lg

2. Copy lg.cgi, as.txt, as-apnic.txt, as-arin.txt, as-ripe.txt, lg.conf and
favicon.ico to this directory, make CGI executable

cp lg.cgi as*.txt lg.conf favicon.ico /usr/local/httpd/htdocs/lg
chmod 644 /usr/local/httpd/htdocs/lg/*
chmod 755 /usr/local/httpd/htdocs/lg/lg.cgi

3. Add these lines to your webserver config (In SuSE it is located at
/etc/httpd/httpd.conf or /etc/httpd/suse_include.conf). The order of these
lines is VERY IMPORTANT

Alias /lg/favicon.ico /usr/local/httpd/htdocs/lg/favicon.ico
ScriptAlias /lg /usr/local/httpd/htdocs/lg/lg.cgi

4. Restart webserver

killall -1 httpd

5. DONE!



                            ADVANCED CONFIURATION


You can generate as-apnic.txt, as-arin.txt and as-ripe.txt files yourself.
Just run Perl script makeaslist.pl and it creates these three files in your
current directory. It is recommended to update these files sometimes to get
fresh information about new AS numbers.

You can also edit as.txt file. These three autogenerated files are included
at the beginning of as.txt file. All lines below just overwrites previous
ones. This means that you can put any better names for AS numbers to this file
and will see it instead of these autogenerated names (which are quite hard to
understand some times).

A little bit about lg.conf file. In this example all logins are replaced with
"login" and passwords with "password". These lines are also commented out, so
you can use this configuration file even without any modification.

As long as the configuration file is quite simple, I don't give here any help
how to configure LG. Just look at lg.conf, all possible ways how to configure
it, are shown in ths file already ;-)

Default logfile is /var/log/lg.log, be sure that your webserver can write
it or use any other file (or don't use art all).



                                    NOTES


Don't try to use LG sites with newer DIGEX code as external LG sites. These
will check Referer and therefore deny all outside links.

There are also some LG sites which support only POST method and are also
unusable. LG can forward browsers to any other address but can't send POST
data with it. It is possible to act as proxy for these sites but this is not
implemented yet and I'm not sure it is neccessary at all. At least at the
current moment ;-)
